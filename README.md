# ParallelComputing

This repository contains the project work developed by Carlos Machado and Gon√ßalo Sousa as part of the MEI Parallel Computing course at the Universidade do Minho. The project is divided into three phases, each focusing on different aspects of optimizing and parallelizing a molecular dynamics simulation code.

# Phase 1: Code Analysis and Optimization

The primary goal of this phase is to explore optimization techniques applied to a single-threaded program. The focus is on using tools for code analysis/profiling to identify key blocks requiring modifications for improved execution performance.

# Phase 2: Shared Memory Parallelism (OpenMP)

This phase focuses on exploring shared memory parallelism using OpenMP directives to further improve overall execution time.

# Phase 3: CUDA

The final phase consists in Design and implement a new version for accelerators (GPU with CUDA).
